    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to apply Reinforcement learning to a problem of path finding. The setting is inspired by [Peter and the Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_the_Wolf) musical fairy tale by Russian composer [Sergei Prokofiev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Prokofiev). It is a story about young pioneer Peter, who bravely goes out of his house to the forest clearing to chase the wolf. We will train machine learning algorithms that will help Peter to explore the surroinding area and build an optimal navigation map.\n",

    "* **a wolf**, which is dangerous and should be avoided\n",

In order not to clutter this notebook too much, we have moved all code to work with the board into separate `rlboard` module, which we will now import.

    "What we also observe on this graph, is that at some point the length increased abruptly. This indicates stochastic nature of the process, and that we can at some point \"sploil\" the Q-Table coefficients, by overwriting them with new values. This ideally should be minimized by decreasing learning rate (i.e. towards the end of training we only adjust Q-Table values by a small value).\n",
